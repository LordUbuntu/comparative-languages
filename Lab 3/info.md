# Lab 3

**Disclaimer**: This assignment done in partial fulfillment of the course CMPT360A (Comparative Programming Languages).

For Lab 3, the challenge was to implement an abstract data type (ADT) in a language they've never used before. The application of this ADT did not have to be complicated, just show that the ADT works the way it should. I chose to implement a Stack in Rust.
