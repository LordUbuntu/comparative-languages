# Lab 1

**Disclaimer**: This assignment done in partial fulfillment of the course CMPT360A (Comparative Programming Languages).

For Lab 1, the challenge was to write a program that takes three Cartesian coordinates (`z1`, `z2`, and `z3`) and calculates the side lengths and angles that a triangle drawn from these three points would have. Program should be able to handle invalid input, such as when all points exist along a line or where two coordinates are identical.

Input would look something like this:
```
0 0
5 0
5 5
```

Output would look something like this:
```
(0, 0)
5
7.07
45
(5, 0)
5
5
90
(5, 5)
5
7
45
```
