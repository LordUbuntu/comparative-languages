# Lab 2

**Disclaimer**: This assignment done in partial fulfillment of the course CMPT360A (Comparative Programming Languages).

For Lab 7, the final lab, the challenge was to write a full program in any language of your choosing. I chose to put my love of programming langauges and what I learned about language design and development to the test by writing an implementation of the [BF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) language interpreter in Python 3.

Input is a BF program. Output is program behaviour.
