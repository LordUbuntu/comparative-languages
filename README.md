# Description

This repository contains source code and brief descriptions on cool code I wrote during my comparative programming languages course for assignments. I absolutely adored taking this course, and treasured the time I spent with my favourite professor (R.S.). Taking this course was a fun excuse for me to do the things I love: programming, problem solving, and programming language learning.

## Tour

* [Language Selection](https://github.com/LordUbuntu/comparative-languages/blob/main/language_selections.md)

This is a list I made in preparation for the course to make it easy to select cool and interesting programming languages during the course duration. Admittedly, I mostly made it because I wanted to collect novel programming languages like players collect pokemon.
