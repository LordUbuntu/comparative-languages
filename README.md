# Description

This repository contains source code and brief descriptions on cool code I wrote during my comparative programming languages course for assignments. I absolutely adored taking this course, and treasured the time I spent with my favourite professor (R.S.). Taking this course was a fun excuse for me to do the things I love: programming, problem solving, and programming language learning.
