# Lab 2

**Disclaimer**: This assignment done in partial fulfillment of the course CMPT360A (Comparative Programming Languages).

For Lab 6, the challenge was to write a "nifty script". I chose to write a passphrase generator in Python 3.

Input looks something like:
```
number of passphrases: 1
words per passphrases: 4
```

Output looks something like:
```
correct horse battery staple
```
