# Lab 2

**Disclaimer**: This assignment done in partial fulfillment of the course CMPT360A (Comparative Programming Languages).

For Lab 2, the challenge was to write an efficient sorting algorithm (I chose quicksort) on lists of 100, 1000, and 10000 values in two languages and compare how they perform.

Input would look something like this:
```
[2, 1, 99 .. 8, 11, 18]
[5, 1, 27 .. 4, 380, 100]
[6, 9, 91 .. 2048, 111, 1313]
```

Output would look something like this:
```
[0, 1, 2 .. 99, 100]
[0, 1, 2 .. 999, 1000]
[0, 1, 2 .. 9999, 10000]
```
